## Introduction

Currently in my 4th year of engineering school, I am working in a team of 6 on a project about dermatology. This application is a prototype of our final solution, SkinCare.

Enjoy !

## Concept

We have the intuition that the French don't take enough care of their skin. They don't find suitable products and have difficulty getting appointments with a dermatologist quickly. 
How can we improve the dermatological follow-up of people with skin problems by offering a personalized, fun and accessible solution?
That's why we thought of an application where we would create a profile by indicating our skin problems and our previous dermatological follow-ups (if any). The application will advise us according to your profile which products to buy (by comparing the price, the efficiency,...), as well as the place where we could buy it (pharmacy, parapharmacy,...).

The application allows to :
- Take a selfie every day to see the follow-up and improvements of our skin 
- Scan our prescriptions, and organize reminders when we have to apply certain treatments (creams, medicines,...) 
- Incorporate our health book and medical record 
- To have access to discussion channels that will allow patients to discuss among themselves in order to give advice
- To have advice according to the external environment every day (for example: apply sunscreen) 
- Scan products to know their composition (such as the YUKA application) 
- To send photos in emergency for problems that seem serious. The photo will be processed in the database, and will come out with an opinion (positive or negative)
- Have a premium version with the possibility to discuss directly with dermatologists, as well as the possibility to send them photos of your skin and have a follow-up.
